"# indexed_search_query" 

This project uses two relation "student" and "faculty". Trying to impelement the project with this two relation.

Trying to build a skeleton of the project. "node" string in the QueryPerser.java file represents a node in the stack. db.properties file has two methods. One method create the files and other method return a string array with the parth of the files.

Things I need to have more clear idea for furthermore:
1. How to insert data in a bin file with starting index
2. How to create the node and how the node will actually work
3. How to merge the file handling part with the query processing part
